        My name is Derek Wall. I was born on June 1st 1999. Love rock music. I'm a bass player in a band, but can also play the drums, piano and a little vocal. I love working out, not to sure why but just enjoy lifting weights. Also enjoy art and designing but have never done this web design stuff before. What else... Movie/comic stuff? I like the sci-fi stuff like Star Wars and Predator. Sorry for short paragraph, not that big of a writer.
